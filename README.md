# Best Privacy Alternatives 

### On my page you’ll find great resources I’ve used for my move towards privacy focused online services. 

**As big tech providers continue to become more greedy for money, our data, and control, it’s time we take action and move towards privacy focused services – and trust me, there are many great privacy focused services for email, web browsers and even communication services that are secure, private, user friendly and really great alternatives.** 

### Change your web browser 

My first recommendation to stop the [app tracking](https://tuta.com/blog/posts/app-tracking) ad targeting and increase your online privacy would be to use a secure, private browser like [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/?redirect_source=firefox-com) but if you’re wanting to do more research on private browsers, their functions and features then here’s a great guide to the [10 best private email services in 2024](https://tuta.com/blog/best-private-email-service)

### Ditch Meta 

Next thing you should do is get rid of all Meta products like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. While Facebook and Instagram might feel okay to delete, the thought of deleting your WhatsApp might freak you out. But it shouldn’t, I’d recommend [Signal](https://signal.org/) as the best alternative to WhatsApp. Here’s a good guide to [best WhatsApp alternatives](https://tuta.com/blog/best-whatsapp-alternatives-privacy) if you want to do more of your own research into providers you could use.

### Change your email provider

Regarding your email provider you really should invest in one that’s privacy focused and offers end-to-end encryption. There are many [free email providers](https://tuta.com/blog/best-free-email-accounts) you can choose from but I’d high recommend reading this article about [the best private email services in 2024](https://tuta.com/blog/best-private-email-service).

Skiff recently announced it will [shut down](https://tuta.com/blog/skiff-shutdown), so if you were thinking of opting for it, [Tuta Mail](https://tuta.com/) would be a much better alternative. 

There are many reasons I’m a Tuta Mail fan, but to name the main ones – first things first, the **whole mailbox and Tuta Calendar is end-to-end encrypted,** so I know that no one except the intended recipient can see my private messages – this is a big relief, as with big tech providers like Gmail, they scan your email contents and peep on your mailbox. Additionally Tuta is fully open source, free to use and comes with zero tracking and no ads. In my opinion it's an ethically run company, that’s fully transparent and one I can trust.
